# Python Basic

I taught about 100 hours Python from scratch both people experienced with IT or another prog. language and people who just knew some basic office stuff.

**This course is for:** Complete beginners in programming and people who know some basics but want to learn some tricks and more about standard libraries.

**This course is not for:** Experienced python programmers or anyone who knows about everything learnpython.org offers

Before the actual course, I strongly recommend to try to get familiar with the language using those tutorials in links below or watching videos and trying out some things on your own.

## Contents|Plan of education

1. Intro; Crash Course through all basics of http://learnpython.org/
2. First useful program, having a problem, solving it, deploying the solution
3. Practice, Practice, Practice!
4. More theory, useful tips, delving deeper in totopic X (Where X is whatever problem students will have)
5. Where to go next, final questions, summary

## Practices

For practice try:

1. Try to write a script(program) where you declare 2 numbers to variables and it compares what is larger, what is smaller or if its equal.
Print out some message for each situation and try all different test cases (first number larger, first number lower, equal numbers)
2. More to come...
